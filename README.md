# a CLI and go SDK for the Synology: `synoctl` and `synology-go`

## Why make this?

Synology NAS devices are popular.

In a home setting, a Synology device is particularly handy as a small, always-on Linux device with abundant local storage.

Out of the box, you can interact with a Synology device through a web-based UI. The Web UI is great for trying new features,
but managing containers or network drives from the UI can be slow and error-prone - classic motivations for a scriptable command-line utility.

The `synoctl` command name follows the tradition of `kubectl`, `journalctl`, `sysctl` and other cli utilities for
managing things.
Hopefully it is easy to type and easy to remember!

## Getting Started with `synoctl`

You can download a precompiled `synoctl` binary from the releases tab in this repository.

Run the `synoctl login` and follow the prompts to authenticate with your Synology host

## Commands for the Container Manager App

![animated demo](docs/demo.gif)

`synoctl` supports these commands. You'll need to install the Container Manager app from Package Center first.

## Thanks

Making a terminal animation with [VHS](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs) was super fun

I came across many examples of folks analyzing and creating clients for the DSM API. Of those, these were particularly informative:
* https://github.com/Xboarder56/SynoDockerContainerUpgrade
* https://github.com/cccheng/ruby-synowebapi/tree/master
* https://github.com/garrettdieckmann/synologyapi

The Synology API has some interesting self-documenting behavior, but parameters for API calls are not documented.
Watching live requests in the developer console while using the Synology UI is the best strategy - the UI is a web application,
and it appears to rely on the same APIs that this client library calls.
